# Spark
About Spark.
When you're walking down the road and you see a Spark on your phone. There's might be someone out there with a similar interest as you. Chat with them on the app till they're around, meet them, and if you like them share contacts by tapping your phone.



## Implementation
Spark is a software app that connects people through real-life interaction. Spark has a special functionality that implements ibeacon to detect when someone that matches a certain threshold of interests based on profile information. If you want to connect with your spark, you can match by tapping your phones together.
